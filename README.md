# ✨ Interactive Starry Background ✨

Welcome to the Interactive Starry Background project! This project utilizes vanilla JavaScript to create an interactive star field in the browser's background. The field consists of a constellation of stars, dynamically moving across the canvas and interconnecting, creating a mesmerizing, ever-changing pattern.
