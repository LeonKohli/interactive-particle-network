## ⚙️ Customization Options

This interactive starry sky offers a variety of options for customization to suit your preferences or project's theme. You can tweak these parameters to change the look and feel of the starry background:

- **`numberOfStars`**: Set the number of stars in your sky. Larger numbers create denser, busier skies.
  
- **`maxDistance`**: Controls the maximum distance for a star connection to be formed. Larger values result in more star connections.

- **`starSize`**: Define the range of possible star sizes. It takes a minimum and maximum value to provide a variety of star sizes.

- **`speedFactor`**: Control the speed at which stars move around the canvas. Higher values result in faster moving stars.

- **`mouseRadius`**: Determines the area around the mouse where stars will attempt to form connections. A larger radius means more stars will react to your mouse movements.

- **`starColor`**: Set the color of the stars.

- **`connectionColor`**: Change the color of the lines that connect stars.

- **`canvasBackgroundColor`**: Alter the background color of your canvas.

- **`lineThickness`**: Adjust the thickness of the connection lines.

- **`starShapes`**: Choose between 'circle' or 'star' shapes for the stars.

- **`randomStarSpeeds`**: By setting this option to true, stars will move at random speeds. 

- **`rotationSpeed`**: Define the range of possible rotation speeds for star-shaped stars.

- **`connectionsWhenNoMouse`**: If this is set to true, some stars will form connections even when the mouse is not on the canvas.

- **`percentStarsConnecting`**: Set the percentage of stars that can connect when the mouse is not on the canvas.

- **`connectionLinesDashed`**: This option allows the connection lines to be dashed.

- **`dashedLinesConfig`**: This sets the configuration for the dashed lines.

- **`canvasGradient`**: Add a gradient for the canvas background. This takes an array of colors to create the gradient.

- **`starDensity`**: Control the density of the stars in your sky. This can be set to 'low', 'medium', 'high', or 'ultra'.

By customizing these options, you can create an interactive starry sky that perfectly matches your aesthetic or the mood you want to set for your users! 💫
